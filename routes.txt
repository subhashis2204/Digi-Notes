  "summary": "The article discusses the financial success of a janitor who invested in blue chip stocks and the downfall of a former Merrill Lynch executive who borrowed heavily to expand his mansion. It also questions the lack of emphasis on soft skills in finance education, such as personal finance and investing psychology, and whether this has actually improved people's ability to manage their finances and prepare for retirement.",
